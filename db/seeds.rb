  description: "Michelin starred Boka Restaurant has been a fixture in Chicago dining since 2003. In January 2014, Chef Lee Wolen joined as Executive Chef/Partner after the restaurant underwent a major renovation. Since his time at Boka, critics have taken notice. Phil Vettel of Chicago Tribune and Eater Chicago both named Lee as “2014 Chef of the Year.” Most recently, Lee was named 2015 “Chef of the Year” and Boka restaurant was awarded 2015 “Restaurant of the Year” at Chicago’s coveted Jean Banchet Awards. Boka’s food features contemporary, American cuisine, focusing on seasonality and sourcing as many local ingredients as possible. Pasty Chef Meg Galus joined Boka’s kitchen in 2015 and provides a seamless transition between savory and sweet, mirroring Wolen’s use of excellent, high quality ingredients that are prepared and plated beautifully.",

"We were there for the Seattle restaurant week and it was a little upsetting that our whole table had to order from the restaurant week menu only. One of my friends wanted to get what’s on the regular menu but we’re told that it would disrupt the time which was ridiculous since we ordered 2 appetizers.

The food was good even though we only had the bread and the butter, and the octopus appetizer. The drinks looked very pristine.

We were just upset about the service and had to leave early. We cannot force our friends to get something from the Seattle restaurant week menu if the person wants something from the regular menu. It was just crazy.
",

"Had Sunday Brunch. The food was excellent. Had eggs benedict with crab. The eggs were cooked to perfection. The fried potatoes were some of the best I have ever had. The service was very good. Highly recommend.",

"This was our first time and we will definitely be back. The food was delicious, presentation was wonderful and Katie our server was the icing on the cake. Best service in a Seattle restaurant in a very long time.",

"Food was amazing and the staff was attentive. Will definitely return.",

"This was a great place for lunch. I highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich - one of best I’ve ever had.
",


"Nice place to have a Saturday morning Brunch",

"We received excellent service at the restaurant. We were a group of four conducting a business luncheon. Food was excellent.",

"Good. Would go back",

"Location is neat near the spheres, very trendy design, and appealing menu options. Food was good but nothing spectacular. We both got ribeye steaks medium rare and they came out raw in the middle, which was particularly concerning since the steaks came cut already so it was not even hidden. We had them cooked longer and when they came back, the plate was missing the leeks that were on top.",

"Staff were super friendly & timely. Food ok, not amazing.",

"Lamb shank was dank",

"Good food, smaller portions (probably what they should be) but eat bite was delicious. The bread and butter was unreal. Kinda loud though.",

"Tasty place, and close to downtown! Enjoyed brunch here with some of my friends and the service was excellent.",

"I’ll go back it was that good !",

"Booked for a friends birthday - food was excellent and menu varied. There was a great drinks menu also with some very creative cocktails.
The restaurant was a great value. Be sure to order the bread and butter the butter has a really addictive flavor.",

"Love the location next to Amazon Spheres. Food and service are outstanding! Miss their sister restaurant in Bellevue. Try the Octopus and avocado toast, yum!",

"Wait or was nice and helpful. I asked for sriracha mayo or chipotle mayo. He told me they do not have but got me sriracha and chalua to mix with my aioli they did give me.",

"Great food - music vibe was strange. Super loud and not great music.",

"2120 had great food. The salmon was really good, but it was upstaged by a fantastic burger. Reasonable price for a nice sitdown dinner. Interesting view of the Amazon pod office next door.",

"I’m extremely picky but everything was great tonight - food, service and ambience.",

"Really enjoyed it. Thank you!",

"We enjoyed a very good dinner. The golden cauliflower was very tasty, a little sweet, and the Mac and Cheese had an amazing blend of light cheeses. The steak and salmon entrees were tremendous.",

"Food was great but it took long time to get our Salad .. also it took some time to get us seated as there was only one person in the front desk who was also attending calls .. however, enjoyed the dining part of it !",

"The waiter recommended the steak, he was right. Delicious",

"Great service, great tasting food!",

"The Chicken was too well done on the outside. Had a chard taste.",

"I thought the food was delicious and the atmosphere to be trendy upscale. The service was great and its a nice place for friends, a date, business dinner or groups. Was a bit empty on a Friday night at 9pm but Seattle seems to be a sleepy city coming from NYC.",

"Excellent food and service and great view. Reservation was ready when we arrived and we were seated immediately.",

"I was not very impressed with the main course meal. I had the garlic shrimp over pasta. I feel as if I could have made it myself and it would have tasted better. I have always loved Anthony's, but it just wasn't good this time.

",

"A pleasant dining experience. Helpful hostess used the reservation comments to prepare a table that was in a good location. Service was excellent and the food was exceptional. Our party of 4 was extremely happy.

",

"Great view, mediocre food and horrible service. Every dish gets rice and green beans. Try a little bit. On a positive note: Best valet ever!",

"Joining me for dinner were some close friends that I had not seen in quite a while. We had a lot to catch up on. After we finished eating we were still taking up the table talking. The restaurant was quite busy, at no time were we rushed to give up the table. I really appreciated that.",


"Excellent Food with outstanding wine list and great service",

"We had the sunset dinner which was a good value. The salmon was done well and tasted great. The chocolate mouse was OK. The staff was very pleasant, friendly and professional. The place has a fantastic view. My only disappointment is that the interior is very dated and that takes away from the ambiance.",

"We got there right before sunset and had a beautiful view! The food was a little to cookie cutter for an expensive restaurant. We all got the same boring sides and salad was not included and way over priced.

Appetizer was good, service great.",

"Great place , great service , generous flavourable portions , and on the waterfront",

"The appetizers were great, the chowder was as well! Unfortunately I found the Lingcod bland and the rice pilaf boring and bland! I would have loved a choice of starch, none given. The green beans were just about perfect , the service was Great!",

"Absolutely amazing!",

"The lamb sirloin is outstanding.A signature dish worth having.",

"One of the most wonderful dining experience , from the Sommelier to the Chef who came out and greeted us personally.",


"One of the best meals I've had. All of the courses were relatively simple, but the flavors were incredible (well beyond their ingredients). I'm still rather blown away thinking back.",

"Perfect food. Chef is a genius. Service is impeccable. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Go now and go often!",

"The meal was excellent. Every course was great, some very simple but delicious, others like the quail in an artichoke showed incredible technique and flavor. Fun wine list is small but hits great wines from everywhere. Service was attentive and unobtrusive. Watching everyone in he open kitchen work so well together was an awesome experience.",

"What a delectable meal! The flavor profiles for each course were simple, yet divine. The service was impeccable. Highly recommend to anyone considering a tasting menu experience.",

"Not worth the $250 per person price. The duck was terrible.",

"Everything and everyone were terrific.",

"my wife and i just finished watching ugly delicious, then we were planning a spring break to the city, decided to give this a whirl.",

"extremely pricey but the most incredible meal I have ever had. everything was well presented and delicious. creative as well",

"Great hospitality. Incredible food. Fantastic wine list. Friendly chefs. Excellent service. Tremendous dining experience.",

"This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.",

"Exceptional meal...great service..only negative was an unapproachable wine list ..although the 75 dollar gammay we had was fantastic .",

"This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.",

"Amazing dinner!!",

"It's a beautiful and experimental menu full of both bright and rich flavors! Highly recommend!",

"Un lugar cercano a la perfección, asumiendo que ésta es para Dios.",

"Everything exceeded our expectations, which were very high. We can't wait to go back!",

"I feel so disappointed. The decorations of dishes are extremely bad. The food tastes moderately. Dishes do not show any techni at all. The ingredients of dishes are also moderately. Won’t go back again. It does not at michelin two stars standard at all.",


"Great service and spectacular food. Always a pleasure to dine here.",

"Spectacular in every way. Truly one of the world’s best.",

"In overall the restaurant is excellent, the food is amazing, the kitchen staff super friendly and nice. The only thing that I would change is the music.",

"This was my second time dining at the new location and it keeps getting better. The creativity and presentation were amazing and the staff was outstanding.",

"The food here is interesting. Like nothing else. Despite there only being 20 or so seats, there's no starting time for meals and so it's somewhat strange with people coming and going.",

"Everything was very good. The food was amazing and very innovative. The only thing I didn’t like were two staff members who gave a pretencious vibe to the place while the others were attentive and very nice. It was just a huge contrast. The place is expensive but for a special occasion is the perfect place to go!",

"Creative food, good service. My only wish was that there were more vegetable dishes and more hot dishes. Felt that most of the dishes were on the room temp or cold. But I am just nitpicking. Great restaurant and good food.",

"Too expensive, not the best Michelin",

"Truly splendid and top notch!",

"Prefer this meal over that of Blanca, which was somewhat spotty.",

"Creative dishes presented with friendly service.
Perhaps the best wine pairing I’ve had.",

"Absolutely OTT, delicious and satisfying. An unique experience",

"Over-priced and underwhelming. Fair food, but didn’t feel experimental or especially tied-together. Some plates were good, many were mediocre, and none wowed.
",

"Excellent!!!! Fantastic I!!!

",
